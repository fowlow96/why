<h1>Detailed Information<br><img style="width:30%;" src="http://i.imgur.com/Ym4KAPI.png"/></h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
Tall, thin, athletic build. As a dancer she's spent a lot of time exercising and expanding on her flexibility. A thin layer of muscle sits under her soft white skin, and pronounces her hourglass figure surprisingly daintily. Shoulder length black hair falls over her shoulders, often styled to something remniscent of the 1950's. Her facial structure is elegant, with high defined cheekbones, an average slightly upturned nose, full lips, slender eyebrows, and round definitely European eyes. Her irises are a soft violet. Oddly enough, the upper tips of her ears are pointed almost elvishly, and huge a huge black tattoo of tribal style butterfly wings covers her whole back. (There is a good example of her physical figure in a picture below.)
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Gossamer is a very kind and gentle woman by nature. She cares very strongly and can easily become attached. She prefers the role of caretaker, and insists on caring for everyone around her before she cares for herself. This is mainly to do with the strong mother-complex she has. When the lives of those near her are threatened she becomes an angry vengeful beast whose objective is one thing and one thing only: protect those she loves.
<br><br>
<b>Attire</b><br>
During her time in the human world, she had adopted the simplistic style of modern human attire. Once her memory and power returned, however, she began wearing more light armor designed for mages as she did before and during the Great War. There are two examples of different kinds of attire she might wear (one above and one below).

<h1>History of a Fae</h1>
Gossamer was never one to argue with Fate or Destiny, she wasn't a stubborn rebel. In fact, the dreams that birthed her made her a gorgeous mother figure, a female to provide care to those in need. She wasn't alone either, she had a counterpart, a twin brother named Foster who was formed from the same dream. It was easy for the two of them to offer protection and happiness to their fellow Faeries, and even more so for the occasional creature that managed to find a way into their home Realm.<br><br>
These twins were two of the first to ever be born, and it was with their help that a King and three Queens divided the land of their Realm equally. The King, however, had a sister whose fate was to some day take his place. This sister, whose name was Morgan, became close friends with both twins, and eventually a forbidden love blossomed between her and the brother. Gossamer spent many nights pleading with her brother, not wanting him to endanger his future and the future of their dearest friend, but her warnings fell on deaf lovestruck ears.<br><br>
While all this was happening, outside of the Faerie Realm a sinister plot thickens. Demonic and Angelic beings, embodiments of light and darkness, catch wind of a new infant world formed entirely out of magic and desire. Both opposing groups become very greedy and feel the need to capture this new world, wanting to make it theirs. Both competed, until a war between the two kinds of beings began in the very world they wanted to claim so badly. The Faeries tried to stay as neutral as possible, but many of them were captured and forced to fight for one side or the other, effectively drawing them into the war.<br><br>
I wish I could say that the Faeries won their home and both Angelics and Demonics were forced out of their borders, but that would be false information. It was the Demonics who won this war, and it was the Demonics who captured the Fae-kind.<br><br>
During the first part of the Great War when it was three parties fighting each other, Morgan and Foster continued to try and meet in secret. Unfortunately, Demonics came across their secret place and captured Morgan while Foster managed to fight his way out and break free. Shortly after this capture, the Demonics won the war and slaughtered the Angelics until none of them were left behind. A heavy oppression on the Faeries began, but the powerful twins stuck together and managed to avoid capture. Gossamer became the head of a resistance group, made of powerful survivors and renegades. Her initial goal was to free Morgan, but as time went on it was clear that she needed to widen her narrow view. So many of her people needed her help. Upon this revelation her tactics became far more violent and vicious, and she was taking out many of the Demonics.<br><br>
There was a prize put on the Faerie's head, but no matter who went for her, they all came back in several separate pieces. It became clear that if they were to subdue this revolution, they were going to have to have someone from the inside bring her to them. A heavy weakness was found. Foster had spent his days continuously failing to free his lover from captivity, and the repeat of his failure started to drive him crazy, he was desperate. The Demonics approached him, telling him that he could trade his sister for his lover, and he agreed. He lured Gossamer into a trap where she was captured, and while she was forced to become a slave, a lapdog for her new masters, Morgan's dead body was delivered to Foster.<br><br>
Driven by anger of betrayal, Gossamer broke free long enough to kill Foster, wanting to "put him out of his misery," and then fled to the human realms. She was found delirious and barely conscious, and when she came to all of her memories were gone.

<div id="tab2">
<h1>Lore Behind the Faerie Realms</h1>
Magic always existed across realities, shaping and forming worlds, causing creatures to adapt during evolution and take all new heights. Among these realms, there was one species that was as common as magic itself, and that species was known as the Human Race. Humans had the ability to access magic from the beginning--they developed mana pools within their body--but they never became aware of their own potential. They had to be helped, and eventually they were, but that's a story for another time.<br><br>
While humans began populating different worlds and started becoming the most common species in existence, their mana went unused and began building up. Then explorers and breeders became dreamers, and their nights were filled with images of objects and events they strongly desired. Their built up mass of unused mana began responding to their dreams. Influenced by the strong desires and emotions of humans, the Faerie Realms were born. It was like a paradise, a world of perfection and balance, where horror lived in harmony with content happiness.<br><br>
Pretty soon a whole new dimension was formed in parallel to all the worlds humans occupied, and a physical place wasn't the only thing their desires formed; eventually an indigenous people were born. These were the first Fae-kind, awaking with a preset purpose and fate, already a specific age, gender, appearance. Of course, they were all beautiful regardless of their fate and their gender.<br><br>
The first Faeries banded together to create a split government and formed the foundation and support that would still uphold their world to this day if it wasn't for the war that destroyed them all.
</div>

<div id="tab3">
<h1>Student at a Magical University</h1>
The very powerful Faerie currently attends a magic academy known as <a target=_blank href="http://ulreich.weebly.com">Ulreich University</a>, where she and a large group of other students study their desired crafts in a very hands-on oriented environment. Interestingly enough, a majority of the students present--if not all--were sent invitations to attend, addressed by the headmaster himself. Who this "Ulreich" man is and what he has to do with the grand scheme of things remains to be seen, but the deeper Gossamer digs, the more worried she becomes. Not only does the faceless master hold many dark secrets, but it seems so does the entire city that occupies and controls the Esmeralda Isles. There's a sense of danger in the air, and she's beginning to think that her invited peers weren't hand picked by accident.
</div>

<div id="tab4">
<h1>The Duty of an Auror</h1>
<i>"Guardians of the school. These mages put the students and general well-being of the school before themselves, acting as the sentinels which keep the peace and erase any threats which may present themselves."</i><br><br>
Gossamer takes this job very seriously. Her nature is to be protective of others. While she struggles with the fact that she failed to protect the innocent several times before, she embraces the opportunity to not only grow in strength but to also pay her debts. There are many lives she feels she owes because they did not deserve to be cut so short, so she has taken the path of an Auror not only to seek redemption, but to also protect those she has come to care deeply for.
</div>

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Racial Abilities</h1>
<b>Immortality</b><br>
The Faeries are "born" into one single physical age and remain that age eternally. They can die from anything except natural causes.
<br>
<b>Mana Sensitivity</b><br>
The Fae-kind are very sensitive to auras and mana, allowing them to feel or see when another being is drawing from their mana pool or activating their mana in general.
<br>
<b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
The body of the Fae-kind is light, petite, and athletic. They can move double the speed of the average human and the strongest Fae's speeds can rival that of a hummingbird's.
<br>
<b>Enhanced Flexibility</b><br>
Their bodies are as flexible as they are light, allowing them to contort their shapes into absurd formations. Something someone would expect to see in a circus act.
<br>
<b>Burning Calories</b><br>
The Fae-kind eat thousands upon thousands of calories on purpose and burn them off very quickly. Physical sugary foods is said to help their mental and magic stability, often allowing them slightly faster mana regeneration than what is average if consumed when their mana-pool is either completely drained or close to it.
<br>
<b>Hidden Wings</b><br>
Tribal-like wing markings cover the backs of the Fae-kind. These tribal markings can grow into actual wings and revert back to markings when mana is used.
</div>

<div id="tab6">
<h1>Universal Spells</h1>
<b>Aura</b><br>
Every living thing has mana, and the colors of their mana and their aura vary from person to person. Gossamer's mana is always a blue color, but varies in its shades depending on her mood.<br>
<i>"Blue is a cool and calming color that shows creativity and intelligence. The color blue is a popular color among large companies, hospitals and airlines. It is a color that symbolizes loyalty, strength, wisdom and trust. Blue color meaning is also known to have a calming effect on the psyche. Blue is the color of the sky and the sea and is often used to represent these images."</i>
<br>
Of all universal auras, there are a standard three that have been taught to mages for hundreds of years: A <b>Utility Aura</b>, an <b>Offensive Aura</b>, and a <b>Defensive Aura</b>. 
<br>
<b>Utility Aura</b><br>
Cast by concentrating on the mind itself, both in a figurative and literal sense. Casters will start by weaving mana directly into their brains, allowing the aura to expand throughout their entire body, flowing directly from the top of their heads. The aura will take a very liquid-like appearance while this spell is cast, flowing downwards over the body in a smooth, gentle motion. The aura will glow lightly, being slightly visible in direct light, but bright enough to glow during the darkness. With the aura up, it increases a being's reflexes and overall agility. The aura will make a person feel extremely awake and alert, and increase their visual perception slightly. This aura will last for a period of four posts, and can be upheld for another four by charging it with mana (expending the cost to bring it up over again).
<br>
<b>Defensive Aura</b><br>
Cast by concentrating on the very thing that keeps you standing. In most cases, this means the caster must begin by weaving mana directly into their spine, and allow it to flow into the rest of their body. This aura takes an extremely solid and rigid appearance; it will form around your entire body like a suit of armor, and does not contain an ethereal glow, rather a shine very similar to polished metal. The spine itself will glow slightly, and pulse, causing energy to run throughout the aura. Takes two turns to cast (one turn to prepare weaving mana into the epicenter, and one post allowing the aura to fully take effect). With the aura up, it is able to provide a x1.5 defense against physical based attacks (both natural and physical mana) as well as a x1.25 defense against energy based attacks. While this aura is active, the user will become more heavy and grounded, making it much harder to stagger or knock them down. As an added bonus, the casters pain tolerance increases significantly. This aura will last for a period of four posts, and can be upheld for another four by charging it with mana (expending the cost to bring it up over again).
<br>
<b>Offensive Aura</b><br>
Cast by concentrating your focus toward the very thing that gives you life. Although various creatures have vital organs in different areas, the most common place for the aura to originate from is the chest, directly in the center. For humans and other similar beings, the heart itself acts as the conduit. The caster must weave mana directly into this organ (or simply a space on the front of their chest) and allow it to spread throughout their entire body. This aura is extremely volatile in nature, and appears very similar to flames covering the beings entirety, crackling and flaring haphazardly around them.Takes two turns to cast (one turn to prepare weaving mana into the epicenter, and one post allowing the aura to fully take effect). With the aura up, it is able to provide a slight boost (x1.5) to a person's physical strength, as well as their casting speed (this does not work for spells that require multiple posts to charge), and spell damage (around x1.25 more power, does not increase the rank of spells). The aura will make a person feel extremely warm and accelerated, creatures who possess hearts and similar organs will find that they will beat extremely fast while the aura is up. This aura will last for a period of four psts, and can be upheld for another four by charging it with mana (expending the cost to bring it up over again). 
<br>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana.
<br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
Basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively.
<br>
<b>Mana Target</b><br>
A small dot of mana that acts as a guide for one's magic. Wherever this target is placed, no matter where or what direction the spell is cast, it will hit the Mana Target.
<br>
<b>Mana Beacon</b><br>
A strong burst of mana used like a distress signal. Nearby mages can feel the beacon and will come to aid the caster.<br>
<b>Mana Meditation</b><br>
This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage meditates on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their undivided attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting--and slowly weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Meditation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance slightly and can calm whatever natural shock they may be experiencing, allowing them to function better. Natural shock meaning the universal spell won't work on magic based shock (i.e. if a spell or magic substance forces the mind and body to go into shock).
</div>

<div id="tab7">
<h1>Primary Tree<br>Enchantment; Auror</h1>
<i>"The art of magical augmentation. Enchanters are able to infuse objects with their magic, granting the object a "Permanent" effect or boon. However, these enchantments must be recharged with the Enchanter's mana to keep these effects/boons active. Only non-biological/sentient objects may be enchanted.​"</i><br>
<br>
<b>Fair-Fire</b><br>
A simple spell that causes the enchanted item to be covered in flames without damaging the item itself. Flames can’t be put out normally, but can be put out by more than just water. Certain magic spells (say a wind mages attack or a water mages attack, or even removing oxygen around the flame by a transmute mage) can still disable it. 
<br>
<b>Fair-Ice</b><br>
A simple enchantment that very quickly sucks any thermal energy it can reach into itself from anything within a twenty foot radius. As long as Gossamer is inside this radius she can pick and choose what thermal energies she wants the enchantment to suck in, and which ones she wants it to ignore. 
Not only does being within radius of this spell cause one's limbs to go frigid and make movement much more difficult, but humans caught within the radius for two or more posts will die. Anything with a weakness to cold or constant loss of thermal energy will die near instantly.
<br>
<b>Titania's Arrow</b><br>
An enchantment that doubles an object's natural speed as long as it's being thrown as a projectile. Cannot reach speeds over 100MPH.
<br>
<b>Bond</b><br>
If two things of physical mass touch an object with this spell attached to it at the same time, the two solid masses will be stuck together permanently until broken by a mage of equal rank to Gossamer (must be done via some sort of spell). Faith mages of at least High Mage and any Enchanter of the same rank can break this spell.  
<br>
<b>Like Glass</b><br>
This enchantment can only be used on solid objects and materials that are already denser and tougher than glass. For as long as the enchantment is active on the object, the object will be no stronger or denser than glass. This spell can be removed by Faith and Enchantment mages of high enough rank (any aforementioned mage type who ranks above Gossamer.) 
Can’t be done to SPECIFIC MEDIUMS  / magical objects.
<br>
<b>Like Stone</b><br>
This enchantment can only be used on solid objects and materials that are already less dense and tough than stone. For as long as the enchantment is active on the object, the object will be as strong and as dense as stone. This spell can be removed by Faith and Enchantment mages of high enough rank (any aforementioned mage type who ranks above Gossamer.) Can’t be done to SPECIFIC MEDIUMS / Magical objects.
<br>
<b>Boom Clap</b><br>
When two objects collide, as long as one of them holds this enchantment, they'll send a blast of force and sound. Strong enough to kill anyone caught in point blank range unless they have substantial defenses set up and can protect against it. The force the spell exerts, however, is a one way road and does not send backlash to the caster, and since the force is pushing the sound with it, being behind the spell rather than in front of it will allow the noise it makes to be tolerable. It will damage the ears of those at point-blank range. 
<br>
<b>Transmogrify</b><br>
This enchantment only works on suits of heavy armor. It lightens the overall weight of the armor to feel like light armor. Will work on any piece of amour, decreasing its weight without removing durability.<br>
<b>Fire's Wrath</b><br>
When excess heat has been applied to the object (for example someone holds it long enough for their natural body heat to effect it) the object will be covered in flames. These flames can be put out by normal means but are very easy to re-light. They behave as normal flames on everything except the item they occupy. This is a permanent enchantment and cannot be stopped until the enchanted object is broken.
<br>
<b>Middle Layer</b><br>
This enchantment only works if another enchantment has been laid on an object prior, and only works for solid objects/constructs. This spell allows her to lay a second enchantment over the first, but no more than that. It doesn't combine the skills of the enchantments, simply allows more than one to be active on an object at a time. (Only two enchantments--aside from this one itself--can be active at once.)
<br>
<b>Steady Shield</b><br>
An enchantment that temporarily expands whatever mass it has been cast on until that mass has expanded to reach six feet in height and six feet in width. It also coats the mass in a layer of hard mana, allowing it to be sturdy against both physical and energy based attacks, especially those lower ranking than the caster, and has a physical toughness of Tungsten. If the spell is deactivated or the wall is shattered, the mass will return to its original size and shape. It takes initial physical touch to cast this enchantment on an object, but as long as the object remains within a twenty foot radius of her body it can be activated without touch. The object that this is cast on must be smaller than five feet at every angle, nonsentient, and weigh less than one hundred pounds.
</div>

<div id="tab8">
<h1>Secondary Tree<br>Stigmatism; Mage</h1>
<i>"Stigmatism is the art of creating Auras around your body based on spirits that you form a close connection to. Stigmatism auras are generally related to an animal, and take on its properties (for example, a Hawk aura would grant increased vision, and faster movement), but they can take on the form of legendary human spirits as well. Each spirit that you use to create an aura from must be attached to the physical world via items that the mage holds on their person."</i>
<br><br>
<b>Flickering Butterfly</b><br>
Through the gift of the beautiful butterfly bracelet from Apollo O'Connor, she decided that her second tree was going to be Stigmatism. This aura simply expands upon her already existent butterfly-wing shaped aura. The intent given to these wings are mostly air-based.<br>
<i>Flight:</i> The stigmatism aura imbued with her already existent wings allows her to hover comfortably up to 15 feet off the ground. She can reach top speeds of 15 MPH while flying.<br>
<i>Guardian:</i> This is the defensive aspect of this aura, if she curls her "wings" around herself protectively, they will act as magic wards. Attacks from equal and lower ranking mages will be blocked. Strong, charged attacks or consecutive attacks can break through, as the spell itself is not consecutive.<br>
<i>Whirlpath:</i> This is the offensive aspect of this particular aura. If she concentrated enough mana into the construct and flaps the wings hard, a strong whirlwind will fly forth with enough force to lift decently large items and throw them like shrapnel. These whirlwinds travel a maximum of five feet away from her body and can immobilize those equal to human weight and throw them like shrapnel as well. Can be detered by other wind based spells.
<br>
<b>Dragon's Shard</b><br>
This stigmatism aura changes her naturally butterfly shaped wings into those shaped much like a dragon's. When this aura is active, she gains a small resistance to fire based attacks but a weakness to electricity, and offers her own fire based spells a x1.5 boost. The item that triggers this aura is a small orange and red charm on a silver necklace chain. 
<br>
<b>Wraith's Kiss</b><br>
When this aura is active, rather than take the shape of wings her aura will have a sickly white appearance to it and would float around her like a thin cloud of smoke. While this is active, if enough of the mist is inhaled then the target will lose consciousness for six hours. Target must breathe in aura for three whole turns before it takes affect. The aura, of course, can be detered by air based spells. The item that triggers this aura is a small obsidian gem set in a simple silver banded ring.
<br>
<b>Feathered Wings</b><br>
This is just the name of the new aura. When activating Feathered Wings, her aura shifts into large birdlike wings. The aura is connected to another gift from Apollo O'Connor, this time being winged earrings.<br>
<i>Angel's Wings:</i> If Gossamer "wraps" her aura-made wings around fellow comrades, she can give a x1.5 boost to their natural speed and their defensive spells. After the initial "contact" with her winged aura, this boost remains active on her allies no matter how far from her they travel so long as her aura remains active.
<br><br>
<h1>Tertiary Tree<br>Radiance:Photokinetics; Beginner Mage</h1>
<i>"Users of Radiance must choose between the ultimate duality; to manipulate the light itself, or manifest their power through the darkness of shadows. Light Radiance, or Photokinesis is primarily concerned with creating bright and powerful energy based attacks, although it is possible to create more physical aspects to its magic at a higher rank. The Radiance trees can be influenced in a number of ways to provide a boon or nerf to its magic, such as bright days increasing the power of Photokinetics, and Dark nights increasing the power of Umbrakinetics."</i>
<br><br>
<b>Glowball</b><br>
A small orb of intense pale blue light is created when this spell is cast. The small construct floats a foot above her head and is bright enough to easily light up a six foot radius around her body. It has no offensive capabilities but staring for extended periods of time directly into the light is not advised. 
<br>
<b>Change of Perception</b><br>
Color is perceived based on how light reflects off of a surface. This spell allows her to coat her body in a thin layer of light so she can "change color." Only works for one color at a time before needing to be recast. 
<br>
<b>Glowing Javelin</b><br>
A four foot staff with a very sharp tip made out of solidified light. It behaves like a regular simple weapon, merely needing to be formed at the cost of mana.
</div>

<div id="tab9">
<h1>Items</h1>
<b>Butterfly Bracelet</b><br>
Embedded with jewels and a graceful make, this precious bracelet was given to her by someone she holds very close to her heart.
<br>
<b>Drangoneye Necklace</b><br>
A stone entirely native to Kre'Nath, it tends to have a blend of reds, golds, and oranges, and a large black crack through the center. This beautiful roughly carved stone hangs as a charm off of a silver chain that hangs around her neck.<br>
<b>Obsidian Ring</b><br>
A very simple silver band with a square-cut obsidian jewel sits on the ring finger of her right hand.<br>
<b>Wing Earrings</b><br>
Another wonderful gift from the same person, a pair of simple diamond earrings. The true design comes from behind, where feathered wings hang from behind the bottom of the ear for about an inch.<br>
<b>Leather Sheathe</b><br>
A black leather sheathe designed to hold the machete, with an adjustable leather strap designed to go over the head and sit most of its weight on the shoulder, so the sheathe would rest against the wearer's back.<br>
<b>Leather Holsters</b><br>
Two black leather holsters with adjustable straps designed to stay firmly on the wearer's upper thigh.<br><br>
<h1>Weapons</h1>
<b>Machete</b><br>
A two foot blade of sharpened steel with a regular wooden handle, wrapped in leather to make an easier grip.<br>
<b>Hunting Knives</b><br>
Two hunting knives with four inch serrated blades, connected to wooden handles wrapped in leather to make an easier grip.

<b>Auroran Globe</b><br>
A small ball that is glass-like in appearance but is as durable as plexiglass. When channeling her mana through it she can shoot small dart-shaped projectiles out of it that carry her enchantments. These projectiles can shoot no faster than a tossed ball. If she is constantly moving the orb in or around her body while a stigmatism aura is active it boosts the stats of said aura. The Auroran Globe can be moved by Gossamer mentally, allowing it to hover in air for up to one foot away from her body if she so chooses. The sphere is no bigger than a baseball. While using this Medium, her spells increase x1.5 in power.
